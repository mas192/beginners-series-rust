# Hello, World!

This directory contains a Hello World program.

Compile this program by running `rustc main.rs`. The Rust compiler will produce a binary executable file in this folder.

The binary executable can then be run using:

- `./main` for Unix/Linux users
- `.\main.exe` for Windows users

After running the executables, you will see the message `Hello, World!` displayed in the output window.
